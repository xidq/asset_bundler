as u can see, some asset_bundler.\
as far as i can tell everyfing except encryption/decryption works fine.\
If u want halp me with that, that will be awesome!\
I'm quite new to programming etc.\

You can:\
-pack/compress files into binary\
-unpack/decompress files from binary\
-batch convert images\
-merge 3 images into 1 (for textures etc)

asset_bundler is compiled for linux\
asset_bundler.exe is compiled for windows (unsigned)\
feel free to test or compile yourself
