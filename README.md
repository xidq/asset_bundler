as u can see, some asset_bundler.\
as far as i can tell everyfing except encryption/decryption works fine.\
If u want halp me with that, that will be awesome!\
I'm quite new to programming etc.\


Main goal is to work with assets for 3d etc.


You can:\
-pack/compress files into binary\
-unpack/decompress files from binary\
-batch convert images\
-merge 3 (or 2 or even 1) images into 1 (as rgb channels: for textures etc)

for now for me it's enough in terms of possibilities, if u have any idea what can be helpful, just let me know ;)

asset_bundler is compiled for linux\
asset_bundler.exe is compiled for windows (unsigned)\
feel free to test or compile yourself


features: 
--raw (no graphics nor audio attached)\
--statystyki (added some stats visible when debug mode is enabled in stats page)
